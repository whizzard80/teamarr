"""Channel numbering and range management.

Handles automatic channel number assignment with three numbering modes:
- strict_block: Reserve by total_stream_count (large gaps, minimal drift)
- rational_block: Reserve by actual channel count rounded to 10 (smaller gaps, low drift)
- strict_compact: No reservation, sequential numbers (no gaps, higher drift risk)

Assignment modes (per-group):
- MANUAL: User sets channel_start, sequential assignment from there
- AUTO: Dynamic allocation based on sort_order and numbering mode

Features:
- Range reservation: Groups reserve space based on numbering mode
- Range validation: Auto-reassign if channel is out of range
- Global range settings: channel_range_start/end in settings
- 100-block intervals: New manual groups start at x01 boundaries
- 10-block packing: Auto groups pack in 10-channel blocks (strict/rational)
