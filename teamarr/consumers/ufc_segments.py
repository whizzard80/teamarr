"""UFC card segment handling.

Expands UFC events into segment-based channels (Early Prelims, Prelims, Main Card).
Streams are routed to correct segment channel based on detected card_segment.

Segment timing comes from ESPN bout-level data:
- PPV events: 3 segments (early_prelims, prelims, main_card)
- Fight Night: 2 segments (prelims, main_card)

Timezone disambiguation uses three-tier priority:
1. Timezone indicator extracted from stream name (e.g., "9PM ET")
2. Group-configured stream_timezone
3. User's configured timezone (fallback)
