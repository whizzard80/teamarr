"""Channel lifecycle management for event-based EPG.

Handles creation and deletion timing for event channels.
Channels are created before events and deleted after.

EPG Association Flow:
1. Generate consistent tvg_id: teamarr-event-{event_id}
2. Create channel in Dispatcharr with this tvg_id
3. Generate XMLTV with matching channel id
4. After EPG refresh, look up EPGData by tvg_id
5. Call set_channel_epg(channel_id, epg_data_id) to associate
